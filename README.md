# Password_Generator-Task-3-
Welcome to the repository for my Task 3 project as an online intern at CodSoft! This project is a Python-based password generator designed to create secure and random passwords.
In today's digital age, maintaining strong and secure passwords is essential for protecting personal and sensitive information. This password generator aims to help users create robust passwords that are difficult to crack.
